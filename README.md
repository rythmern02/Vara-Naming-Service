## 🔍 What is VNS?

**Vara Naming Service (VNS)** is a decentralized identity layer for the Vara Network, offering secure, human-readable domain names like `alice.vara` and `dapp-hub.vara`.  
Built on the **Gear Protocol** and powered by **asynchronous smart contracts**, VNS replaces cryptographic addresses with intuitive, meaningful names — unlocking identity, reputation, and ownership for dApps, users, and DAOs.
